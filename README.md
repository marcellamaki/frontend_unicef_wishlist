This project is the beginning of a "WishList" portion of a physical-goods caching network.

The broad idea for the wishlist is that:
  * Buyers can browse goods by category. Their searches are saved to a database, which is fed to stockists
  * Stockists can have a dashboard that compares their current offerings with what buyers are requesting  
  * Stockists can update their preferences, which are then viewable to sellers, who can make, create, and sell goods accordingly

The backend is the most robust portion where the relationships are displayed.

The frontend focuses on the potential for a buyer dashboard, and there are a few empty components that demonstrate how this might be built out into a larger project.

This project requires React and Rails running on Postgres
